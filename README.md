Project was made in 1st grade of university with basic knowledge of HTML.<br>
It was required to make home page, about me page, page about one programming language that professor assigned to us and page about online school.<br>
I used imgur for pictures, but this code isn't a good example because it has inline CSS and whole process of making it was based on basic things that we studied.<br>
Still proud of it beacuse I had zero experince with this kind of stuff, great for the first time.
